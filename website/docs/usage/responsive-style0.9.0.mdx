title: Responsive style 👗
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Thanks to the Muuri layout engine, you can create any type of `layout` and size the Items as desired simply by setting the CSS style _(width, height, margin and padding)_.

<div>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/dashboard.gif')} style={{width: '45%'}} />
  <img style={{width: '4%'}} />
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('gifs/mediaquery.gif')}
    style={{width: '44%', paddingBottom: '1%'}}
  />
</div>

A very common case is to use the MuuriComponent as a `grid` divided into equal cells, and to position each Item in one or more cells. The implementation would be very simple:

:::info
If you need `4 columns`, and an Item on each column, just use `width: 25%;` in the style of the Items. Very simple and effective.
:::

If you want to create more dynamic styles by managing them directly in the component, Muuri-react provides two extremely simple `utilities` to generate the style of the Items in these cases.

## Utility: getResponsiveStyle 📦

```js
import {getResponsiveStyle} from 'muuri-react';
```

With this utility you can virtually divide the MuuriComponent into `columns` and set the Item to be as wide as `n` of these columns. In addition you can also set the **margin** _(static or dynamic)_, the **ratio** _(dynamic)_ between width and height or the **height** _(static)_.

```js
// The responsive style.
const responsiveStyle = getResponsiveStyle({
  // The Muuri component is virtually divided into 8 columns,
  // the width of the item will be 3 columns (minus the margin).
  columns: 3 / 8,
  // The margin of the item, it can be any CSS values
  // valid for the margin expressed in "px" or "%".
  margin: '5%',
  // The width/height ratio. If you want to set a static
  // height just set the "height" option in px and remove the "ratio".
  ratio: 1.5,
});
```

So you just need to apply the style. The inner element must have `position: absolute;`.

```jsx
// The Item component.
const Item = ({text}) => (
  <div style={responsiveStyle}>
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        left: 0,
        top: 0,
        right: 0,
        bottom: 0,
      }}>
      I'm an item.
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

The utility does not take into account the **border** for the outer element, you can use the border in a **descending** element (or change [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing)).

## Utility: getStaticStyle 📦

```js
import {getStaticStyle} from 'muuri-react';
```

When `dragging` an Item with dimensions relative to the MuuriComponent (e.g. `width: 25%`), the `dragFixed` prop is used to fix its dimensions (see more [here](../usage/items-dimensions#dimensions-when-dragging-)).

This utility offers more `flexibility` than dragFixed and can be useful in cases where the Item has to be dragged between different MuuriComponents and assume different `sizes` (as in the gif).

```jsx
// The Item component.
const Item = () => {
  // Get the Muuri instance.
  const {grid} = useGrid();
  // If the item is dragging.
  const isDragging = useDrag();

  // Item dimensions.
  const columns = 3 / 8;
  const margin = '5%';
  const ratio = 1.5;

  // If the item is dragging the style
  // has to be static.
  const style = !isDragging
    ? getResponsiveStyle({columns, margin, ratio})
    : getStaticStyle({grid, columns, margin, ratio});

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      <div className="item-content" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Gotchas: overflow 🔥

Let's say you have a `overflow-y: auto;` element, which you use as a scroll container. The MuuriComponent is as wide as the container, the items have `width: 25%;`. In each row there should be **4** Items.

When the app starts, this happens:

- The MuuriComponent is **initially** 100px wide, the Items will be 25px wide.
- The Items are many and the MuuriComponent do not fit in the container, the **scrollbar** appears.
- The width of the MuuriComponent **decreases** because of the scrollbar, let's say about 90px.
- The CSS engine does **NOT** update the Items size which remain at 25px, causing an unwanted layout.

The size of the Items will be updated (by the CSS engine) to 22.5px only after a window **resizing event**.

:::info When
This problem occurs when relative sizes are used (e.g. `width: 25%;`) and the `scrollbar` appears / disappears.
:::

:::danger
Be careful that the problem does `not` arise `immediately`, in fact the first layout is calculated correctly before the scrollbar appears. However, when the layout is recalculated with the scrollbar present, for example following a drag, the Muuri engine will find the Muuricomponent 90px wide and the items 25px wide. In the new layout there will therefore be 3 items per row.
:::

:::tip solution
To solve the problem simply use `overflox-y: scroll` to make the scroll bar fixed.
